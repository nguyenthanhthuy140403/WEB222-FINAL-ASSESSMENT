      <h2>Basin Head Provincial Park</h2>
      <p>Basin Head, located 13 kilometres east of Souris (the closest town), received its name from its wide, hollow bowl shaped form, like a basin. For many years it was a productive fishing area, with many local fisherman making their living fishing off shore. In 1937, it was decided to build a harbour and maintain a wharf at Basin Head. Much dredging was done, and the result was the large sand dunes on the beach which still remain today.</p>
      <p>Basin Head Provincial park is located on Route 16 in the Points East Coastal Drive region. The park is a short 15 minute drive from Souris.</p>
      <p>Basin Head Provincial Park adventures, tours, guides and activities most enjoyed in and around the park are swimming, diving, tubing, beachcombing, sightseeing, and dog walking. The highlights of the the Basin Head Provincial Park are the long sandy beach, Basin Head Fisheries Museum, and the bridge (also known as the "Run" due to the fact that people love jumping off it into the canal below)</p>

      <h2>Manitoulin Island</h2>
      <p>Manitoulin means spirit island in Anishinaabemowin (Ojibwe language). The island is considered sacred by the Native Anishinaabe people, who identify as the "People of the Three Fires." This loose confederation is made up of the Ojibwe, Odawa and Potawatomi tribes.</p>
      <p>There are 7 ways to get from Toronto to Manitoulin Island by bus, car ferry, car or plane.</p>
      <p>We recommend making your visit a Manitoulin Island long weekend rather than a day trip. There are so many things to do on Manitoulin Island that itâ€™s worth spending some extra time. You can extend your trip to Manitoulin Island even further by taking the time to explore Bruce Peninsula National Park and Fathom Five National Marine Park. Manitoulin Island itself can be explored at a casual pace over a couple of days. And it makes an excellent Ontario road trip destination.</p>

      <h2>Dinosaur Provincial Park</h2>
      <p>Established on June 27, 1955 as part of Alberta's 50th Jubilee Year with the goal of protecting the fossil beds, the first warden was Roy Fowler (1902-1975), a farmer and amateur fossil hunter.</p>
      <p>The Dinosaur Provincial Park Visitor Centre features exhibits about dinosaurs, fossils, and the geology and natural history of the park. There is a video theatre, fossil prep lab area, and a gift shop. Public programs are offered in the summer.</p>
